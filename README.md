# self-studying

Hi, this is my GitHub space for self-studying.

I have been curious about the world of finance and its intersection with statistics and probability. I've decided to self-study these topics. I've begun reading Blitzstein's "Introduction to Probability" and will be documenting my learning inside and outside of that book here.
